## To This Skill

PRs welcome. The skill should encode real lessons from contributing to OpenClaw.

If you have a lesson learned from a failed PR, add it to the Common Mistakes section in AGENTS.md.

## To OpenClaw (using this skill)

Read SKILL.md. The workflow is:

1. Check for duplicates (commands/checkduplicates.md)
2. Analyze the issue (commands/analyzeissue.md)
3. Create the fix (commands/createfix.md)
4. Submit the PR (commands/submitpr.md)
5. If broken, close it (commands/closebadpr.md)

The most important step is #1. We learned this by closing 38 of our 40 PRs.
