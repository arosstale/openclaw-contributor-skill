## To This Skill

PRs welcome. The skill encodes real lessons from contributing to OpenClaw.

If you have a lesson learned from a failed PR, add it to the Anti-Patterns table in SKILL.md.

## To OpenClaw (using this skill)

Read SKILL.md for the full workflow. The command order is:

1. `commands/triage.md` — Is this worth fixing?
2. `commands/checkdupe.md` — Anyone already on it?
3. `commands/analyze.md` — Find root cause + ALL pattern instances
4. `commands/fix.md` — Implement, format, lint
5. `commands/submit.md` — PR with required template
6. `commands/audit.md` — Post-session health check on all open PRs
7. `commands/rebase.md` — Keep PRs fresh before merge windows
8. `commands/close.md` — Close broken/duplicate PRs honestly

**The most important steps are #1 and #2.** We learned this by closing 38 of our 40 PRs.
